:peepoWave: hey guys! Our 2nd time in the Arena with Swivel, and this time we're largely focused on the changes we've introduced in our v3


[07/12/2022 6:33 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
**New in v3:**
The core difference really is the introduction of `p` (protocol) in our order struct, as well as the abstraction of external methods for ctoken.`withdraw` `deposit` and `exchangeRate`

What that does is let us integrate with more protocols (aave, yearn, euler, etc.,), meaning we're hoping to test those external interface interactions


[07/12/2022 6:36 PM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
**Other new additions to look at:**
- Swivel.sol and Marketplace.sol `authRedeem` to enable external 5095 redemptions
- Marketplace `createMarket` split actual contract deployment into Creator.sol to open up bytecode space
- Addition of delayed workflow to fee changes, approvals

Hey Julian, I'm a little confused as to which contracts are in / out of scope. For example, the table in the README mentions `Marketplace.sol` but based on what I've read in the README, it seems the libs e.g. `Compounding.sol` are also part of the scope?

[07/13/2022 7:06 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
For sure! I'd 100% clarify that `Compounding.sol` is in scope, as its where our abstraction of `exchangeRate` sits


[07/13/2022 7:06 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
Beyond that I'd say most everything other than some of the implementation details of our ERC-5095 are in scope for reports


[07/13/2022 7:07 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
And our focus is primarily on the addition of `p` to the order structs, and the external abstractions: 
- the `deposit` and `withdraw` abstractions in Swivel.sol
- the `Compounding.sol` library


[07/13/2022 7:11 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
This is where the impactful changes of our v3 sit, which are relatively compartmentalized.
(Otherwise we'd have done a longer audit)

That said, it'd be silly to not provide context with the wider codebase so its all included in scope for reports

{Reactions}
💯 

[07/13/2022 7:14 AM] Julian | Illuminate#0001
**So the only things explicitly *NOT* in scope:**
- Details of 5095 implementation (the EIP isnt final yet)
- A few external Libs: 
        - FixedPointMathLib
        - LibCompound
        - LibFuse
        - Safe.sol
- Some older stuff not worth a review:
        - Hash.sol
        - Sig.sol

Thanks a lot ser 🤝


[07/13/2022 12:33 PM] benbaessler
So `Swivel.sol` is in scope, right?

[07/13/2022 5:49 PM] rob_rob#1703
I'd echo what @Julian | Illuminate pointed out in Swivel.sol - the `deposit` and `withdraw` abstractions which utilize `p` to determine appropriate action


[07/13/2022 9:23 PM] benbaessler
got it, thanks! 👍
